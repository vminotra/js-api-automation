Feature: Create snippets on glot.io

# Scenario: Create a new snippet by an anonymous user
#     When I call the create snippet endpoint
#     And I call the returned snippet url
#     Then returned snippet url contents should match the contents passed to create snippet api

# Scenario: Create a new snippet for a user using the auth token
#     When I create a new snippet using an existing auth token
#     And I list the snippets of the user corresponding to the auth token
#     Then the first item should be the newly created snippet
