# js-api-automation
### An API automation framework built using Javascript and Cucumber

**Which API tests am I automating?**<br>
In this framework, I am testing the APIs of https://glot.io/ 
since its an application I'm familiar and it has a simple and well-documented set of endpoints.<br>
*More info about https://glot.io/ APIs*: https://github.com/glotcode/glot/tree/master/api_docs

**Steps to run the framework**<br>
Run the following commands in terminal:<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/vminotra/js-api-automation.git
cd js-api-automation
npm install
npm run test
```

TO-DO list:
- [ ] Fix the scenarios for *update snippet* and *delete snippet* endpoints
- [ ] Add scenarios for the *execute snippet* endpoint
- [ ] Add report generation to the framework
