# js-api-automation
### An API automation framework built using Javascript and Cucumber

**Which API tests am I automating?**<br>
In this framework, I am testing the APIs of https://glot.io/ <br>
It has a simple and well-documented set of endpoints which should be easy for a beginner in API test automation to follow.<br>
*More info about https://glot.io/ APIs*: https://github.com/glotcode/glot/tree/master/api_docs

**Steps to run the framework**<br>
Run the following commands in terminal:<br>
```
git clone https://github.com/vminotra/js-api-automation.git
cd js-api-automation
npm install
npm run test
```

TO-DO list:
- [x] Fix the scenarios for *update snippet* and *delete snippet* endpoints
- [x] Add scenarios for the *execute snippet* endpoint
- [ ] Add report generation to the framework
